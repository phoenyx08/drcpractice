---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
On 1 December 2022, the Claimant requested the payment of solidarity contribution on the basis of the transfer of the player from the Former Club, FC Rostov, to the Respondent. 2
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In its calculation, the Claimant considered to be entitled to 1.27% of the amounts paid by the Respondent to the Former Club. 3
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The player was registered with the Claimant for 924 days, between 1 January 2015 and 12 July 2017, from the season of his 20th birthday until the one of his 22nd birthday. 4
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
On 5 October 2020, the player was transferred from the Former Club to the Respondent for a EUR 7,500,000 fixed fee, bonuses of EUR 500,000 for 10, 15 and 20 goals/assists, as well as 15% sell-on clause. 5
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Claimant, previously made aware of the transfer conditions on TMS 11607, which was closed for the lack of the presentation of the Bank Account Registration Form, requested to receive as solidarity contribution: a
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
EUR 95,250 (EUR 7,500,000 x 1.27%) over the fixed fee; and b
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
EUR 6,350 (EUR 500,000 x 1.27%) over the bonus for 10 goals/assists. 6
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Respondent argued the Claimant’s claim should be dismissed for being time-barred, in accordance with Article 23.3 of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP), as more than two years elapsed between the transfer agreement date, on 30 September 2020, as well as the transfer date on 5 October 2020, and the filing of the present claim, on 1 December 2022. 7
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
If FIFA did not consider the claim time-barred, the Respondent continued its reply by stating that the transfer agreement determined the payment of the fixed fee would be: a
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
EUR 2,500,000 due on 30 November 2020; b
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
EUR 2,000,000 due on 30 April 2021; c

---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
EUR 1,200,000 due on 30 June 2022. 8
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
However, the Respondent argued it paid the fixed fee to the Former Club as shown below, and that it should be responsibility of the latter to distribute the solidarity contribution to training clubs, as the Claimant: a

The Respondent did not contest that the 10 goal/assist bonus had been triggered. 10
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
As the transfer fee is inclusive of solidarity contribution, the Respondent requested that, in the unlikely event of a condemnation, that it should be the Former Club the one held responsible for paying the training entitlement to the Claimant. 11
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Moreover, the Respondent brought to the attention of the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the Football Tribunal that Art. 2.5. of the Transfer Agreement states that: “The Clubs agree that they will share the burden of the FIFA Solidarity Contribution due to any of the Player’s former training clubs under the FIFA Regulations, as follows: • 50% (fifty percent) to be borne by Genoa; and • 50% (fifty percent) to be borne by Rostov
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Therefore, Genoa shall have the right to deduct from any payment under the present Contract to Rostov a percentage of 50% (fifty percent) of FIFA Solidarity Contribution due to any of the Player’s former training clubs, and the rest 50% (fifty percent) the Genoa shall pay on its own costs”. 12
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Because of that, the Respondent requested that, in the event of being condemned to pay solidarity contribution to the Claimant, that the Former Club should be ordered to reimburse 50% of these amounts. 13
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Lastly, the Respondent stated that the solidarity contribution percentage due to the Claimant is not of 1.27% but of 1.264%. 14
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Considering its arguments, the Respondent requested that: a. the claim is dismissed for being time-barred; b. if solidarity contribution is considered due, that the Former Club should be condemned to pay it; and, subsidiarily, c. the Former Club is ordered to reimburse 50% of the amounts that the Respondent eventually is condemned to pay to the Claimant. 15
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Former Club informed FIFA on 19 June 2023 that it originally agreed with the Respondent on sharing the responsibility of paying solidarity contribution. 16
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
However, because of the Respondent’s lack of payment of the transfer fee, a contractual dispute procedure was opened, FPSD-684 / 21-00149, and the “ADDENDUM NO. 2 TO THE AGREEMENT FOR THE PERMANENT TRANSFER OF THE PLAYER ELDOR SHOMURODOV”, provided to FIFA by the Former Club, was signed, determining: Page 5 of 12 {{$$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S$H}zfmM=$} REF TMS 11927 “4

Furthermore, the Parties agree in modification of article 2.5 of the Agreement, that Genoa shall not deduct from the Fixed Transfer Fee any amounts with regard to FIFA Solidarity Contribution which may be due as a result of the transfer of the Player to Genoa, pursuant to Article 21 of the FIFA RSTP
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Instead, Genoa shall pay to Rostov the full amounts of the Installments of the Fixed Transfer Fee without any deduction, and Genoa shall in addition pay and distribute the applicable Solidarity Contribution payments to all entitled third parties and shall indemnify Rostov from any claims of third parties in this respect.”. 17
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In light of the above, the Former Club is of the opinion that it is exclusively the responsibility of the Respondent to distribute solidarity contribution

Article 1 par. 1 of Annex 5 RSTP stipulates that if a professional moves during the course of a contract, 5% of any compensation, not including training compensation paid to his former club, shall be deducted from the total amount of this compensation and distributed by the new club as a solidarity contribution to the club(s) involved in his training and education over the years
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
This solidarity contribution reflects the number of years (calculated pro rata if less than one year) he was registered with the relevant club(s) between the calendar years of his 12th and 23rd birthdays. 7
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
As indicated on the player passport issued by the Uzbekistan Football Association, the player was registered with the Claimant between 1 January 2015 and 12 July 2017, i.e.: a

The entire calendar year of the player’s 21st birthday; and c. 193 days on the calendar year of the player’s 22nd birthday. 8

The Claimant is entitled to receive 25.28% of the solidarity contribution due. 22
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Therefore, the Claimant is entitled to receive EUR 101,120, corresponding to: a. 25.28% of EUR 125,000, i.e
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
EUR 31,600; b. 25.28% of EUR 100,000, i.e

---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
It is uncontested that, to date, the Respondent did not pay any of the due solidarity to the Claimant. 24
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Respondent argued that, because of the conditions foreseen in the transfer agreement regarding the player, the Former Club should be the one responsible for the payment of the full solidarity contribution. 25
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Alternatively, the Respondent requested that the Former Club should be ordered by FIFA to reimburse 50% of the amounts after they were paid to the Claimant, also in accordance with the transfer agreement regarding the player. 26
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
As shown above, under the RSTP, it is the responsibility of the new club, i.e. the Respondent, to distribute solidarity contribution
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
However, given the contractual provisions agreed with the Former Club, the latter was notified to present its arguments on whose responsibility it would be to pay solidarity contribution. 27
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Former Club replied to FIFA that, despite the contractual provisions, the Respondent is responsible to pay solidarity contribution because of the contractual dispute FPSD- 684 / 21-00149 and the determination on the “ADDENDUM NO. 2 TO THE AGREEMENT FOR THE PERMANENT TRANSFER OF THE PLAYER ELDOR SHOMURODOV” that followed it. 28
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The addendum presented by the Former Club, and signed by the latter and the Respondent, clearly states “Genoa (i.e., Respondent) shall in addition pay and distribute the applicable Solidarity Contribution payments to all entitled third parties”. 29
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Therefore, solidarity contribution is to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimant, as contractually agreed by the Former club and the Respondent. 30
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---

1. On 1 December 2022, the Claimant requested the payment of solidarity contribution on the basis of the transfer of the player from the Former Club, FC Rostov, to the Respondent. 2. In its calculation, the Claimant considered to be entitled to 1.27% of the amounts paid by the Respondent to the Former Club. 3. The player was registered with the Claimant for 924 days, between 1 January 2015 and 12 July 2017, from the season of his 20th birthday until the one of his 22nd birthday. 4. On 5 October 2020, the player was transferred from the Former Club to the Respondent for a EUR 7,500,000 fixed fee, bonuses of EUR 500,000 for 10, 15 and 20 goals/assists, as well as 15% sell-on clause. 5. The Claimant, previously made aware of the transfer conditions on TMS 11607, which was closed for the lack of the presentation of the Bank Account Registration Form, requested to receive as solidarity contribution: a. EUR 95,250 (EUR 7,500,000 x 1.27%) over the fixed fee; and b. EUR 6,350 (EUR 500,000 x 1.27%) over the bonus for 10 goals/assists. 6. The Respondent argued the Claimant’s claim should be dismissed for being time-barred, in accordance with Article 23.3 of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP), as more than two years elapsed between the transfer agreement date, on 30 September 2020, as well as the transfer date on 5 October 2020, and the filing of the present claim, on 1 December 2022. 7. If FIFA did not consider the claim time-barred, the Respondent continued its reply by stating that the transfer agreement determined the payment of the fixed fee would be: a. EUR 2,500,000 due on 30 November 2020; b. EUR 2,000,000 due on 30 April 2021; c. EUR 1,800,000 due on 31 October 2021; and d. EUR 1,200,000 due on 30 June 2022. 8. However, the Respondent argued it paid the fixed fee to the Former Club as shown below, and that it should be responsibility of the latter to distribute the solidarity contribution to training clubs, as the Claimant: a. EUR 500,000 on 23 December 2020; b. EUR 1,000,000 on 30 March 2020; c. EUR 1,000,000 on 31 March 2021; and d. EUR 5,000,000 on 23 April 2021.

The Respondent did not contest that the 10 goal/assist bonus had been triggered. 10. As the transfer fee is inclusive of solidarity contribution, the Respondent requested that, in the unlikely event of a condemnation, that it should be the Former Club the one held responsible for paying the training entitlement to the Claimant. 11. Moreover, the Respondent brought to the attention of the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the Football Tribunal that Art. 2.5. of the Transfer Agreement states that: “The Clubs agree that they will share the burden of the FIFA Solidarity Contribution due to any of the Player’s former training clubs under the FIFA Regulations, as follows: • 50% (fifty percent) to be borne by Genoa; and • 50% (fifty percent) to be borne by Rostov. Therefore, Genoa shall have the right to deduct from any payment under the present Contract to Rostov a percentage of 50% (fifty percent) of FIFA Solidarity Contribution due to any of the Player’s former training clubs, and the rest 50% (fifty percent) the Genoa shall pay on its own costs”. 12. Because of that, the Respondent requested that, in the event of being condemned to pay solidarity contribution to the Claimant, that the Former Club should be ordered to reimburse 50% of these amounts. 13. Lastly, the Respondent stated that the solidarity contribution percentage due to the Claimant is not of 1.27% but of 1.264%. 14. Considering its arguments, the Respondent requested that: a. the claim is dismissed for being time-barred; b. if solidarity contribution is considered due, that the Former Club should be condemned to pay it; and, subsidiarily, c. the Former Club is ordered to reimburse 50% of the amounts that the Respondent eventually is condemned to pay to the Claimant. 15. The Former Club informed FIFA on 19 June 2023 that it originally agreed with the Respondent on sharing the responsibility of paying solidarity contribution. 16. However, because of the Respondent’s lack of payment of the transfer fee, a contractual dispute procedure was opened, FPSD-684 / 21-00149, and the “ADDENDUM NO. 2 TO THE AGREEMENT FOR THE PERMANENT TRANSFER OF THE PLAYER ELDOR SHOMURODOV”, provided to FIFA by the Former Club, was signed, determining: Page 5 of 12 {{$$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S$H}zfmM=$} REF TMS 11927 “4. Furthermore, the Parties agree in modification of article 2.5 of the Agreement, that Genoa shall not deduct from the Fixed Transfer Fee any amounts with regard to FIFA Solidarity Contribution which may be due as a result of the transfer of the Player to Genoa, pursuant to Article 21 of the FIFA RSTP. Instead, Genoa shall pay to Rostov the full amounts of the Installments of the Fixed Transfer Fee without any deduction, and Genoa shall in addition pay and distribute the applicable Solidarity Contribution payments to all entitled third parties and shall indemnify Rostov from any claims of third parties in this respect.”. 17. In light of the above, the Former Club is of the opinion that it is exclusively the responsibility of the Respondent to distribute solidarity contribution. II. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS Applicable law: Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP): October 2020 edition. Procedural Rules Governing the Football Tribunal (Procedural Rules): March 2023 edition. Decision: 1. The Respondent requested the claim to be considered inadmissible for being time- barred. The Respondent based its request on the fact that the Claimant filed the present claim more than two years after the signing of the transfer agreement. 2. Article 2.1. of Annex 5 RSTP determines that “the new club shall pay the solidarity contribution to the training club(s) (…) no later than 30 days after the player’s registration or, in case of contingent payments, 30 days after the date of such payments”. 3. The first instalment of the transfer fee agreed between Respondent and Former Club was due on 30 November 2020. Through the application of the above-mentioned article of RSTP, solidarity contribution over the first instalment of the transfer fee became outstanding on 30 December 2020. 4. The present claim was filed on 1 December 2022. Between 30 December 2020 and 1 December 2022 less than two years have elapsed. 5. In light of the above, the present claim is admissible.

Article 1 par. 1 of Annex 5 RSTP stipulates that if a professional moves during the course of a contract, 5% of any compensation, not including training compensation paid to his former club, shall be deducted from the total amount of this compensation and distributed by the new club as a solidarity contribution to the club(s) involved in his training and education over the years. This solidarity contribution reflects the number of years (calculated pro rata if less than one year) he was registered with the relevant club(s) between the calendar years of his 12th and 23rd birthdays. 7. As indicated on the player passport issued by the Uzbekistan Football Association, the player was registered with the Claimant between 1 January 2015 and 12 July 2017, i.e.: a. The entire calendar year of the player’s 20th birthday; b. The entire calendar year of the player’s 21st birthday; and c. 193 days on the calendar year of the player’s 22nd birthday. 8. Based on the above, the Claimant shall be entitled to receive as solidarity contribution 1.264% of any payment made in relation to a transfer of the player, or 25.28% of the solidarity contribution due, corresponding to: a. 0.5% of the transfer fee, or 10% of the solidarity contribution due, for the entire calendar year of the player’s 20th birthday; b. 0.5% of the transfer fee, or 10% of the solidarity contribution due, for the entire calendar year of the player’s 21st birthday; and c. 0.264% of the transfer fee, or 5.28% of the solidarity contribution due, for the 193 days on the calendar year of the player’s 22nd birthday. 9. Article 1, par. 1 of Annex 5 RSTP foresees that 5% of any compensation paid by the new club to the former club shall be deducted and distributed by the new club a solidarity contribution. 10. It is uncontested that on 5 October 2020, the player was transferred from his Former Club, FC Rostov (Russia), to the Respondent as a professional. 11. In this respect, the Respondent agreed to pay to the Former Club: a. EUR 2,500,000 due on 30 November 2020; b. EUR 2,000,000 due on 30 April 2021; c. EUR 1,800,000 due on 31 October 2021; d.

EUR 500,000 bonus if the player reaches 20 goals/assists; and h. 15% sell-on over the profit in case of the player’s permanent transfer to a third club. 12. Therefore, the Respondent shall deduct 5% of any of the above due instalments as solidarity contribution and distribute it accordingly between the training clubs of the player. 13. The solidarity contribution generated by the payment of the first instalment corresponds to 5% of EUR 2,500,000, i.e. EUR 125,000. 14. The solidarity contribution generated by the payment of the second instalment corresponds to 5% of EUR 2,000,000, i.e. EUR 100,000. 15. The solidarity contribution generated by the payment of the third instalment corresponds to 5% of EUR 1,800,000, i.e. EUR 90,000. 16. The solidarity contribution generated by the payment of the fourth instalment corresponds to 5% of EUR 1,200,000, i.e. EUR 60,000. 17. It is an uncontested allegation that the EUR 500,000 bonus for 10 goals/assists was also paid. The solidarity contribution generated by it corresponds to 5% of its amount, i.e. EUR 25,000. 18. In accordance with article 2 par. 1 of Annex 5 RSTP, the new club of a player shall pay the solidarity contribution to the training club(s) no later than 30 days after the player’s registration or, in case of contingent payments, 30 days after the date of such payments. 19. Thus, the Respondent had 30 days to pay any solidarity contribution generated by the payment of any of the above due instalments to the training clubs. 20. In fact, the Respondent had: a. until 30 December 2020 to pay any due solidarity contribution generated by the first instalment; b. until 30 March 2021 to pay any due solidarity contribution generated by the second instalment; c. until 30 November 2021 to pay any due solidarity contribution generated by the third instalment; d. until 30 July 2022 to pay any due solidarity contribution generated by the fourth instalment; and Page 8 of 12 {{$$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$$}} REF TMS 11927 e. for the 10 goal/assist bonus, even though its triggering it is uncontested, the date of triggering is not specified, and, because of that, it is unclear until when the solidarity contribution generated by it was to be paid. 21. The Claimant is entitled to receive 25.28% of the solidarity contribution due. 22. Therefore, the Claimant is entitled to receive EUR 101,120, corresponding to: a. 25.28% of EUR 125,000, i.e. EUR 31,600; b. 25.28% of EUR 100,000, i.e. EUR 25,280; c. 25.28% of EUR 90,000; i.e. EUR 22,752; d. 25.28% of EUR 60,000, i.e. EUR 15,168; and e. 25.28% of EUR 25,000, i.e. EUR 6,320. 23. It is uncontested that, to date, the Respondent did not pay any of the due solidarity to the Claimant. 24. The Respondent argued that, because of the conditions foreseen in the transfer agreement regarding the player, the Former Club should be the one responsible for the payment of the full solidarity contribution. 25. Alternatively, the Respondent requested that the Former Club should be ordered by FIFA to reimburse 50% of the amounts after they were paid to the Claimant, also in accordance with the transfer agreement regarding the player. 26. As shown above, under the RSTP, it is the responsibility of the new club, i.e. the Respondent, to distribute solidarity contribution. However, given the contractual provisions agreed with the Former Club, the latter was notified to present its arguments on whose responsibility it would be to pay solidarity contribution. 27. The Former Club replied to FIFA that, despite the contractual provisions, the Respondent is responsible to pay solidarity contribution because of the contractual dispute FPSD- 684 / 21-00149 and the determination on the “ADDENDUM NO. 2 TO THE AGREEMENT FOR THE PERMANENT TRANSFER OF THE PLAYER ELDOR SHOMURODOV” that followed it. 28. The addendum presented by the Former Club, and signed by the latter and the Respondent, clearly states “Genoa (i.e., Respondent) shall in addition pay and distribute the applicable Solidarity Contribution payments to all entitled third parties”. 29. Therefore, solidarity contribution is to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimant, as contractually agreed by the Former club and the Respondent. 30. The well-established jurisprudence of the DRC applies a 5% interest per annum as from the first overdue day for the payment of solidarity contribution.

According to article 25 par. 2 of the Procedural Rules, procedural costs are payable for disputes between clubs regarding the payment of training compensation. 34. The amount claimed by the Claimant corresponds to an amount higher than USD 100,000 and lower than USD 149,999. Therefore, procedural costs levied in this respect are fixed at USD 15,000 (cf. art. 2 of Annexe 1 to the Procedural Rules) 35. According to article 25 par. 5 of the Procedural Rules, the chamber will decide the amount that each party is due to pay, in consideration of the parties’ degree of success and their conduct during the procedure, as well as any advance of costs paid. In exceptional circumstances, the chamber may order that FIFA assumes all procedural costs. 36. In view the specific circumstances of the case, procedural costs shall be set at USD 10,000. 37. In view of the outcome of the claim, said costs shall be borne by the Respondent in full. 38. Article 24 RSTP is applicable to the matter at hand.

On 1 December 2022, the Claimant requested the payment of solidarity contribution on the basis of the transfer of the player from the Former Club, FC Rostov, to the Respondent. 2. In its calculation, the Claimant considered to be entitled to 1.27% of the amounts paid by the Respondent to the Former Club. 3. The player was registered with the Claimant for 924 days, between 1 January 2015 and 12 July 2017, from the season of his 20th birthday until the one of his 22nd birthday. 4. On 5 October 2020, the player was transferred from the Former Club to the Respondent for a EUR 7,500,000 fixed fee, bonuses of EUR 500,000 for 10, 15 and 20 goals/assists, as well as 15% sell-on clause. 5. The Claimant, previously made aware of the transfer conditions on TMS 11607, which was closed for the lack of the presentation of the Bank Account Registration Form, requested to receive as solidarity contribution: a. EUR 95,250 (EUR 7,500,000 x 1.27%) over the fixed fee; and b. EUR 6,350 (EUR 500,000 x 1.27%) over the bonus for 10 goals/assists. 6. The Respondent argued the Claimant’s claim should be dismissed for being time-barred, in accordance with Article 23.3 of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP), as more than two years elapsed between the transfer agreement date, on 30 September 2020, as well as the transfer date on 5 October 2020, and the filing of the present claim, on 1 December 2022. 7. If FIFA did not consider the claim time-barred, the Respondent continued its reply by stating that the transfer agreement determined the payment of the fixed fee would be: a. EUR 2,500,000 due on 30 November 2020; b. EUR 2,000,000 due on 30 April 2021; c. EUR 1,800,000 due on 31 October 2021; and d. EUR 1,200,000 due on 30 June 2022. 8. However, the Respondent argued it paid the fixed fee to the Former Club as shown below, and that it should be responsibility of the latter to distribute the solidarity contribution to training clubs, as the Claimant: a. EUR 500,000 on 23 December 2020; b. EUR 1,000,000 on 30 March 2020; c. EUR 1,000,000 on 31 March 2021; and d. EUR 5,000,000 on 23 April 2021.

The Respondent did not contest that the 10 goal/assist bonus had been triggered. 10. As the transfer fee is inclusive of solidarity contribution, the Respondent requested that, in the unlikely event of a condemnation, that it should be the Former Club the one held responsible for paying the training entitlement to the Claimant. 11. Moreover, the Respondent brought to the attention of the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the Football Tribunal that Art. 2.5. of the Transfer Agreement states that: “The Clubs agree that they will share the burden of the FIFA Solidarity Contribution due to any of the Player’s former training clubs under the FIFA Regulations, as follows: • 50% (fifty percent) to be borne by Genoa; and • 50% (fifty percent) to be borne by Rostov. Therefore, Genoa shall have the right to deduct from any payment under the present Contract to Rostov a percentage of 50% (fifty percent) of FIFA Solidarity Contribution due to any of the Player’s former training clubs, and the rest 50% (fifty percent) the Genoa shall pay on its own costs”. 12. Because of that, the Respondent requested that, in the event of being condemned to pay solidarity contribution to the Claimant, that the Former Club should be ordered to reimburse 50% of these amounts. 13. Lastly, the Respondent stated that the solidarity contribution percentage due to the Claimant is not of 1.27% but of 1.264%. 14. Considering its arguments, the Respondent requested that: a. the claim is dismissed for being time-barred; b. if solidarity contribution is considered due, that the Former Club should be condemned to pay it; and, subsidiarily, c. the Former Club is ordered to reimburse 50% of the amounts that the Respondent eventually is condemned to pay to the Claimant. 15. The Former Club informed FIFA on 19 June 2023 that it originally agreed with the Respondent on sharing the responsibility of paying solidarity contribution. 16. However, because of the Respondent’s lack of payment of the transfer fee, a contractual dispute procedure was opened, FPSD-684 / 21-00149, and the “ADDENDUM NO. 2 TO THE AGREEMENT FOR THE PERMANENT TRANSFER OF THE PLAYER ELDOR SHOMURODOV”, provided to FIFA by the Former Club, was signed, determining: Page 5 of 12 {{$$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S$H}zfmM=$} REF TMS 11927 “4. Furthermore, the Parties agree in modification of article 2.5 of the Agreement, that Genoa shall not deduct from the Fixed Transfer Fee any amounts with regard to FIFA Solidarity Contribution which may be due as a result of the transfer of the Player to Genoa, pursuant to Article 21 of the FIFA RSTP. Instead, Genoa shall pay to Rostov the full amounts of the Installments of the Fixed Transfer Fee without any deduction, and Genoa shall in addition pay and distribute the applicable Solidarity Contribution payments to all entitled third parties and shall indemnify Rostov from any claims of third parties in this respect.”. 17. In light of the above, the Former Club is of the opinion that it is exclusively the responsibility of the Respondent to distribute solidarity contribution. II. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS Applicable law: Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP): October 2020 edition. Procedural Rules Governing the Football Tribunal (Procedural Rules): March 2023 edition. Decision: 1. The Respondent requested the claim to be considered inadmissible for being time- barred. The Respondent based its request on the fact that the Claimant filed the present claim more than two years after the signing of the transfer agreement. 2. Article 2.1. of Annex 5 RSTP determines that “the new club shall pay the solidarity contribution to the training club(s) (…) no later than 30 days after the player’s registration or, in case of contingent payments, 30 days after the date of such payments”. 3. The first instalment of the transfer fee agreed between Respondent and Former Club was due on 30 November 2020.

Article 1 par. 1 of Annex 5 RSTP stipulates that if a professional moves during the course of a contract, 5% of any compensation, not including training compensation paid to his former club, shall be deducted from the total amount of this compensation and distributed by the new club as a solidarity contribution to the club(s) involved in his training and education over the years. This solidarity contribution reflects the number of years (calculated pro rata if less than one year) he was registered with the relevant club(s) between the calendar years of his 12th and 23rd birthdays. 7. As indicated on the player passport issued by the Uzbekistan Football Association, the player was registered with the Claimant between 1 January 2015 and 12 July 2017, i.e.: a. The entire calendar year of the player’s 20th birthday; b. The entire calendar year of the player’s 21st birthday; and c. 193 days on the calendar year of the player’s 22nd birthday. 8. Based on the above, the Claimant shall be entitled to receive as solidarity contribution 1.264% of any payment made in relation to a transfer of the player, or 25.28% of the solidarity contribution due, corresponding to: a. 0.5% of the transfer fee, or 10% of the solidarity contribution due, for the entire calendar year of the player’s 20th birthday; b. 0.5% of the transfer fee, or 10% of the solidarity contribution due, for the entire calendar year of the player’s 21st birthday; and c. 0.264% of the transfer fee, or 5.28% of the solidarity contribution due, for the 193 days on the calendar year of the player’s 22nd birthday. 9. Article 1, par. 1 of Annex 5 RSTP foresees that 5% of any compensation paid by the new club to the former club shall be deducted and distributed by the new club a solidarity contribution. 10. It is uncontested that on 5 October 2020, the player was transferred from his Former Club, FC Rostov (Russia), to the Respondent as a professional. 11. In this respect, the Respondent agreed to pay to the Former Club: a. EUR 2,500,000 due on 30 November 2020; b. EUR 2,000,000 due on 30 April 2021; c. EUR 1,800,000 due on 31 October 2021; d.

Therefore, the Respondent shall deduct 5% of any of the above due instalments as solidarity contribution and distribute it accordingly between the training clubs of the player. 13. The solidarity contribution generated by the payment of the first instalment corresponds to 5% of EUR 2,500,000, i.e. EUR 125,000. 14. The solidarity contribution generated by the payment of the second instalment corresponds to 5% of EUR 2,000,000, i.e. EUR 100,000. 15. The solidarity contribution generated by the payment of the third instalment corresponds to 5% of EUR 1,800,000, i.e. EUR 90,000. 16. The solidarity contribution generated by the payment of the fourth instalment corresponds to 5% of EUR 1,200,000, i.e. EUR 60,000. 17. It is an uncontested allegation that the EUR 500,000 bonus for 10 goals/assists was also paid. The solidarity contribution generated by it corresponds to 5% of its amount, i.e. EUR 25,000. 18. In accordance with article 2 par. 1 of Annex 5 RSTP, the new club of a player shall pay the solidarity contribution to the training club(s) no later than 30 days after the player’s registration or, in case of contingent payments, 30 days after the date of such payments. 19. Thus, the Respondent had 30 days to pay any solidarity contribution generated by the payment of any of the above due instalments to the training clubs. 20. In fact, the Respondent had: a. until 30 December 2020 to pay any due solidarity contribution generated by the first instalment; b. until 30 March 2021 to pay any due solidarity contribution generated by the second instalment; c. until 30 November 2021 to pay any due solidarity contribution generated by the third instalment; d. until 30 July 2022 to pay any due solidarity contribution generated by the fourth instalment; and Page 8 of 12 {{$$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$$}} REF TMS 11927 e. for the 10 goal/assist bonus, even though its triggering it is uncontested, the date of triggering is not specified, and, because of that, it is unclear until when the solidarity contribution generated by it was to be paid. 21. The Claimant is entitled to receive 25.28% of the solidarity contribution due. 22. Therefore, the Claimant is entitled to receive EUR 101,120, corresponding to: a. 25.28% of EUR 125,000, i.e. EUR 31,600; b. 25.28% of EUR 100,000, i.e. EUR 25,280; c. 25.28% of EUR 90,000; i.e. EUR 22,752; d. 25.28% of EUR 60,000, i.e. EUR 15,168; and e. 25.28% of EUR 25,000, i.e. EUR 6,320. 23. It is uncontested that, to date, the Respondent did not pay any of the due solidarity to the Claimant. 24. The Respondent argued that, because of the conditions foreseen in the transfer agreement regarding the player, the Former Club should be the one responsible for the payment of the full solidarity contribution. 25. Alternatively, the Respondent requested that the Former Club should be ordered by FIFA to reimburse 50% of the amounts after they were paid to the Claimant, also in accordance with the transfer agreement regarding the player. 26. As shown above, under the RSTP, it is the responsibility of the new club, i.e. the Respondent, to distribute solidarity contribution. However, given the contractual provisions agreed with the Former Club, the latter was notified to present its arguments on whose responsibility it would be to pay solidarity contribution. 27. The Former Club replied to FIFA that, despite the contractual provisions, the Respondent is responsible to pay solidarity contribution because of the contractual dispute FPSD- 684 / 21-00149 and the determination on the “ADDENDUM NO. 2 TO THE AGREEMENT FOR THE PERMANENT TRANSFER OF THE PLAYER ELDOR SHOMURODOV” that followed it. 28. The addendum presented by the Former Club, and signed by the latter and the Respondent, clearly states “Genoa (i.e., Respondent) shall in addition pay and distribute the applicable Solidarity Contribution payments to all entitled third parties”. 29. Therefore, solidarity contribution is to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimant, as contractually agreed by the Former club and the Respondent. 30. The well-established jurisprudence of the DRC applies a 5% interest per annum as from the first overdue day for the payment of solidarity contribution.

In view of that, the DRC must decide if the amount of USD 300,000 asGAM provided by the Respondent can be encompassed as compensationin the meaning of the RSTPand, if so, what it is the amount of solidarity contribution due to the Claimant. 7

Article 21 and Annexe 5, article 1, of FIFA RSTP, set forth that any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of the player, except for training compensation, shall be subjected to solidarity contribution

Additionally, the FIFA Commentary on the solidarity contribution is subject to any compensation paid for the transfer of the player, regardless of whether it is described as part of the transfer fee or not . 8

According to the DRC and CAS jurisprudence, cannot be considered as a narrow interpretation and therefore shall not be strict to the monetary naturepaidfor the transfer of the player, but it includes any financial benefit which may derive from the transfer of a player

In fact, the DRC concluded several times that the exchange of players indirectly implied a financial agreement, i.e. an agreement with a monetary component, due to the fact that the relevant qualities of the players have an economic value in the football employment market. 9

Against the above framework, according to the MLS Rules, the GAM corresponds to an amount available to MLS clubs annually in addition to its salary budget, which can be used in several circumstances such as the signing of new players to MLS, the re-assigning of an existing MLS player, and to off-set loan and transfer fees. 10
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In other words, the increasing of the GAM of an MLS club corresponds to a financial advantage to such club considering the different possibilities in which the club can spend this resource
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The higher the amount of GAM available to a club, the higher the amount that can be spent on signing new players or on compensation of loan or transfer fees. 11
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The MLS Rules also foresee that an MLS club may reduce 100% of a loan or transfer fee using the GAM. 12
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In this respect and according to the strict financial MLS rules on the amount that can be spent by MLS clubs, it seems that any amount of GAM provided to an MLS club in exchange of the registration of a player corresponds to a payment of compensation that can be spend within the parameters established by the MLS Rules. 13
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Bearing in mind that the RSTP clearly establishes the entitlement of solidarity contribution on any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of the player, regardless the nature of the compensation, the amount of GAM provided by the Respondent shall be encompassed as a transfer compensation and the Claimant is entitled to solidarity contribution for the transfer of the player

Finally, and again given the nature of the GAM as described above, the DRC held that any other conclusion as regards the GAM would be to the detriment of uniformity, equality and certainty on football at a global scale because it would enable USA (or Canadian) clubs forming part of the MLS to have a financial advantage over the rest 15

Consequently, the amount to be taken into account to calculate the solidarity contribution due to the Claimant is USD 300,000. 16

---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
As established above in point II.4, the Claimant is entitled to receive 21.59% of the due solidarity contribution, i.e. 1.0795% of the total transfer amount agreed for the transfer of the player, corresponding to: 10.11% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 37 days the 10% solidarity contribution for the 365 d birthday; and 50.14% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 183 days of the calendar . 21
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Based on the above, the Respondent shall pay the Claimant solidarity contribution of USD 3,237.94. 22
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In addition, the Claimant requested the payment of interests over the claimed amount at a rate of 5% p.a.as of the due date. 23. -established jurisprudence of the DRC with regard to interest, the Claimant is entitled to receive interest of 5% p.a. over the amount payable as solidarity contribution as of the 31st day after the date of registration of the player on the permanent basis, i.e. 12 December 2022

In view of all the above, the claim of the Claimant is accepted and the Claimant is entitled to receive USD 3,237.94 as solidarity contribution, plus 5% interest p.a., as from 12 December 2022 until the date of effective payment. 25

On 08 February 2023, the Major League Soccer (MLS) disclosed the conditions agreed between Columbus Crew (Former club) and the Respondent for the transfer of the player. According to the MLS, (i) the player was re-assigned from Columbus Crew to the Respondent on 11 November 2022 without signing a transfer agreement; (ii) the above- mentioned clubs agreed on the transfer of the player in exchange for USD 300,000 as General Allocation Money (GAM); (iii) no compensation payment was agreed upon for the transfer of the playerand the Claimant is not entitled to solidarity contribution.

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS Applicable law: Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP): October 2022 edition Procedural Rules Governing the Football Tribunal (Procedural Rules): November2022 edition Jurisdiction: yes, uncontested. Admissible: yes, uncontested. Proposed Decision: 1. The Claimant requested the payment of solidarity contribution resulting from the transfer of the player from Columbus Crew (USA) to the Respondent. 2. The Respondent did not provide its comments in respect of the present claim. 3. Art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 RSTP stipulates that if a professional moves during the course of a contract, 5% of any compensation, not including training compensation paid to his former club, shall be deducted from the total amount of this compensation and distributed by the new club as a solidarity contribution to the club(s) involved in his training and education over the years. This solidarity contribution reflects the number of years (calculated pro rata if less than one year) he was registered with the relevant club(s) between the years of his 12th and 23rd birthdays. 4. It is uncontested that in accordance with the player passport issued by the CBF on 29 May 2018, the player was registered with the Claimant as follows: (i) from 17 July 2012 until 22 August 2012, corresponding to 37 days of the calendar thbirthday; (ii) (ii) from 01 March 2013 until 19 August 2023 and from 01 December 2013 until 31 th birthday; (iii) the entire calendar year of the thbirthday; and (iv) from 01 January 2015 until 02 July 2015, corresponding to 183 days of the calendar thbirthday. 5.

In view of that, the DRC must decide if the amount of USD 300,000 asGAM provided by the Respondent can be encompassed as compensationin the meaning of the RSTPand, if so, what it is the amount of solidarity contribution due to the Claimant. 7. Article 21 and Annexe 5, article 1, of FIFA RSTP, set forth that any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of the player, except for training compensation, shall be subjected to solidarity contribution. Additionally, the FIFA Commentary on the solidarity contribution is subject to any compensation paid for the transfer of the player, regardless of whether it is described as part of the transfer fee or not . 8. According to the DRC and CAS jurisprudence, cannot be considered as a narrow interpretation and therefore shall not be strict to the monetary naturepaidfor the transfer of the player, but it includes any financial benefit which may derive from the transfer of a player.

As established above in point II.4, the Claimant is entitled to receive 21.59% of the due solidarity contribution, i.e. 1.0795% of the total transfer amount agreed for the transfer of the player, corresponding to: 10.11% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 37 days the 10% solidarity contribution for the 365 d birthday; and 50.14% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 183 days of the calendar . 21. Based on the above, the Respondent shall pay the Claimant solidarity contribution of USD 3,237.94. 22. In addition, the Claimant requested the payment of interests over the claimed amount at a rate of 5% p.a.as of the due date. 23. -established jurisprudence of the DRC with regard to interest, the Claimant is entitled to receive interest of 5% p.a. over the amount payable as solidarity contribution as of the 31st day after the date of registration of the player on the permanent basis, i.e. 12 December 2022. Page 7of 10 REF TMS 12286 24. In view of all the above, the claim of the Claimant is accepted and the Claimant is entitled to receive USD 3,237.94 as solidarity contribution, plus 5% interest p.a., as from 12 December 2022 until the date of effective payment. 25.

Page 3of 11 REF TMS 11871 Claimant club: ZAMORA F.C.(Venezuela) Respondent club: New England Revolution(USA) Claim and Response: 1
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
On 22November2022, the Claimant lodged a claim against the Respondent requesting the payment of “24.36% of the total solidarity contribution, plus 5% p.a. interest as of the due date, until the date of effective payment”. 2
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Claimant stated that according to information provided by the Major League Soccer (MLS), the player was transferred from Charlotte MLS (Former club) to the Respondent for a transfer compensation
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In this respect, the Claimant referred to art. 1 of Annexe 5 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP) to inform that solidarity contribution is due over any compensation involved in the transfer of the player. 3
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
On 7 March 2023, the Major League Soccer (MLS), on behalf of the Respondent, informed that no transfer agreement was signed between the parties and no compensation payment was agreed upon for the transfer of the player. 4
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The MLS pointed out that all MLS player contracts are agreed between MLS and the player and governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement between MLS and the Major League Soccer Players Association (CBA)
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In this respect, a player may be re-assigned to different MLS clubs without signing a transfer agreement, maintaining the same employment contract with the league. 5
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The MLS stated that on 4 August 2022, the player was re-assigned from Charlotte MLS to the Respondent without signing a transfer agreement
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Consequently, there is no transfer agreement to be disclosed to FIFA. 6
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The MLS indicated that the MLS Roster & Budget Guidelines (hereinafter MLS Rules) ‘’prohibit payments from one MLS team to another MLS team in consideration for trade of a player’’ and foresee specific cases in which a player may be exchanged, none of which with monetary value. 7
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The MLS informed that the transfer of the player from Charlotte MLS to the Respondent occurred in compliance with the MLS Rules, and the above-mentioned clubs agreed on the transfer of the player in exchange for USD 400,000 as General Allocation Money (GAM)
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In this respect, the MLS explained that GAM ‘’is a mechanism governed by the CBA that allows teams to shift a portion of their Salary Budged (commonly referred to as a ‘’salary cap’’) to another MLS team’’and ‘’it can be used only within an MLS team’s Salary Budged’’
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Page 4of 11 REF TMS 11871 8
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Finally, the MLS stated that since no payment was made for the transfer of the player, the Claimant is not entitled to solidarity contribution. 9
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
On 23 March 2023, the Claimant provided its comments to the Respondent’s reply and rejected the Respondent’s allegation that the player was transferred without payment of compensation. 10
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Claimant stated that the MLS confirmed the exchange of the player for USD 400,000 of GAM. 11
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
According to the Claimant, the GAM corresponds to additional money available annually to MLS clubs, which can be provided to the clubs in specific cases, such as: Failure to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs; The transfer of a club’s player to non-MLS club outside MLS; Qualification for the CONCACAF
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Champions League; Expansion Clubs; Expansion Dilution; and Designated Player charge distribution. 12
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Additionally, the Claimant pointed out that GAM can be used on several occasions,such as: (i) to "buy-down" a player's Salary Budget Charge as part of managing a club's roster, including buying down a Salary Budget Charge below the League maximum of $612,500; (ii) to sign players new to MLS (that is, a player who did not play in MLS during the previous season); (iii) to re-sign an existing MLS player; (iv) to off-set acquisition costs (loan and transfer fees); (v) in connection with the extension of a player's contract for the second year provided the player was new to MLS in the immediately prior year; (vi) to reduce the Salary Budget Charge of a Designated Player to a limit of $150,000; (vii) to reduce the Salary Budget Charge of a Player whose Salary Budget Charge exceeds the Maximum Salary Budget Charge to a limit of $150,000; and also that the GAMcan be used to reduce 100% of a loan or transfer fee. 13
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In this respect, the Claimant referred to art. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP and the FIFA Commentary on the RSTP, which foresee that any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of a player is subject to solidarity contribution, regardless of whether it is described as part of the transfer fee or not. 14
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Claimant added that the concept of “compensation” has been interpreted broadly by the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the Football Tribunal (DRC) in cases such as the swap of players or the triggering of a buy-out clause, and the only compensation which is not subject to solidarity contribution is training compensation. 15
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Moreover, the Claimant stated that, according to CAS jurisprudence, (i) the term “compensation” is not limited to the idea of “transfer fee” stricto sensu and must encompass any amount paid by a club on the transfer of a player; (ii) all the elements that should be considered on the transfer of a player for the purpose of solidarity contribution are met in the present case since the Former club consented to release the player, the Respondent consented to secure the player’s services, the player agreed with the transfer, and compensation was paid in form of GAM; and (iii) the RSTP refers to Page 5of 11 REF TMS 11871 compensation without specifying its nature and the Swiss law foresees that the idea of exchange of good involves two sales contracts, and in the present case the financial compensation for the exchange of the player is the amount of 400,000 of GAM. 16
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Finally, the Claimant reiterated that the clubs agreed on the amount of USD 400,000 as GAM for the transfer of the player, which was available to the Former club to use in several ways, demonstrating the financial value agreed between the clubs and which shall be subjected to solidarity contribution. 17

---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Proposed Decision: 1
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Claimant requested the payment of solidarity contribution resulting from the transfer of the player from Charlotte MLS (USA) to the Respondent. 2
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
According to the Claimant, the Respondent paid for the transfer of the player the amount of USD 400,000 as GAM, which can be used in several situations according to the MLS Rules
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In this respect, the Claimant stated that this amount of GAM corresponds to compensation paid for the transfer of the player and, therefore, shall be subject to solidarity contribution. 3
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The Respondent argued that no payment was made for the transfer of the player and no solidarity contribution is due to the Claimant. 4
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 RSTP stipulates that if a professional moves during the course of a contract, 5% of any compensation, not including training compensation paid to his former club, shall be deducted from the total amount of this compensation and distributed by the new club as a solidarity contribution to the club(s) involved in his training and education over the years
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
This solidarity contribution reflects the number Page 6of 11 REF TMS 11871 of years (calculated pro rata if less than one year) he was registered with the relevant club(s) between the years of his 12th and 23rd birthdays. 5
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
It is uncontested that in accordance with the player passport issued by the FVF on 24 January 2022, the player was registered with the Claimant as follows: (i) from 01 July 2016 until 31 December 2016, corresponding to 184 days of the calendar year of the player’s 16thbirthday; (ii) from 30 January 2017 until 31 December 2017, corresponding to 336 days of the calendar year of the player’s 17thbirthday; (iii) from 01 January 2018 until 30 July 2018, corresponding to 211 days of the calendar year of the player’s 18thbirthday; and (iv) from 26 July 2019 to 31 December 2019, corresponding to 159 days of the calendar year of the player’s 19thbirthday. 6
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
It is uncontested that the player was transferred from Charlotte FC to the Respondent on 04 August 2022 in exchange for USD400,000asGAM. 7
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In view of that, the DRC must decide if the amount of USD 400,000 asGAM provided by the Respondent can be encompassed as compensation in the meaning of the RSTP and, if so, what it is the amount of solidarity contribution due to the Claimant. 8
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Article 21 and Annexe 5, article 1, of FIFA RSTP, set forth that any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of the player, except for training compensation, shall be subjected to solidarity contribution
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Additionally, the FIFA Commentary on the Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players (hereinafter the “FIFA Commentary”) states thatsolidarity contribution is subject to any compensation paid for the transfer of the player, ‘’regardless of whether it is described as part of the transfer fee or not”. 9
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
According to the DRC and CAS jurisprudence, the concept of “compensation” cannot be considered as a narrow interpretation and therefore shall not be strict to the monetary naturepaidfor the transfer of the player, but it includes any financial benefit which may derive from the transfer of a player
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
This approach has been applied by CAS and the DRC in cases of entitlement of solidarity contribution triggered by the activation of a buy-out clause orthe swap of players
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In fact, the DRC concluded several times thatthe exchange of players indirectly implied a financial agreement, i.e. an agreement with a monetary component, due to the fact that the relevant qualities of the players have an economic value in the football employment market. 10
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Against the above framework, according to the MLS Rules, GAM corresponds to an amount available to MLS clubs annually in addition to its salary budget, which can be used in several circumstances such as the signing of new players to MLS, the re-assigning of an existing MLS player, and to off-set loan and transfer fees. 11
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In other words, the increasing of the GAM of an MLS club corresponds to a financial advantage to such club considering the different possibilities in which the club can spend Page 7of 11 REF TMS 11871 this resource
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The higher the amount of GAM available to a club, the higher the amount that can be spent on signing new players or on compensation of loan or transfer fees. 12
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The MLS Rules also foresee that an MLS club may reduce 100% of a loan or transfer fee using the GAM. 13
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In this respect and according to the strict financial MLS rules on the amount that can be spent by MLS clubs, it seems that any amount of GAM provided to an MLS club in exchange of the registration of a player corresponds to a payment of compensation that can be spend within the parameters established by the MLS Rules. 14
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Bearing in mind that the RSTP clearly establishes the entitlement of solidarity contribution on any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of the player, regardless the nature of the compensation, the amount of GAM provided by the Respondent shall be encompassed as a transfer compensation and the Claimant is entitled to solidarity contribution for the transfer of the player. 15
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Finally, and again given the nature of the GAM as described above, the DRC held that any other conclusion as regards the GAM would be to the detriment of uniformity, equality and certainty on football at a global scale because it would enable USA (or Canadian) clubs forming part of the MLS to have a financial advantage over the rest simply because of the MLS’ internal organisation. 16
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Consequently, the amount to be taken into account to calculate the solidarity contribution due to the Claimant is USD 400,000. 17
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
According to art. 1 and 2 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, the player’s new club, i.e. the Respondent, is ordered to remit the relevant proportion(s) of the 5% solidarity contribution to the club(s)involved in the player’s training. 18
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
It remained undisputed that the Respondent did not pay the solidarity contribution to the Claimant in relation to the amount agreed for the transfer of the player, i.e
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
According to art. 21 and art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, 5% of the above compensationshall be deducted as solidarity contribution. 20
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
As per art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, solidarity contribution for the calendar year of a player’s 16thto 23rdbirthday amounts to 10% of the total solidarity contributionand it is to be calculated on a pro rata basis if a player is registered for less than a year (cfr
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP). 21
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
As established above in point II.5, the Claimant is entitled to receive 24.37% of the due solidarity contribution, corresponding to: 50.27% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 184 days of the calendar year of the player’s 16th birthday; 92.05% of the 10% Page 8of 11 REF TMS 11871 solidarity contribution for the 336 days of the calendar year of the player’s 17thbirthday; 57.81% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 211 days of the calendar year of the player’s 18th birthday; and 43.56% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 159 days of the calendar year of the player’s 19thbirthday. 22
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Based on the above, the Respondent shall pay the Claimant solidarity contribution of USD 4,873.96 23
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In addition, the Claimant requested the payment of interests over the claimed amount at a rate of 5% p.a.as of the due date. 24
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Therefore, taking into account the Claimant’s claim and the well-established jurisprudence of the DRC with regard to interest, the Claimant is entitled to receive interest of 5% p.a. over the amount payable as solidarity contribution as of the 31st day after the date of registration of the player on the permanent basis, i.e.4 September 2022. 25
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In view of all the above, the claim of the Claimant is accepted,and the Claimant is entitled to receive USD 4,873.96 as solidarity contribution, plus 5% interest p.a., as from 4 September 2022 until the date of effective payment. 26
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Art. 25 par. 2 of the Procedural Rules stipulates that costs in the maximum amount of USD 25,000 are levied in connection with proceedings before the DRC of the Football Tribunal relating to disputes regarding training compensation and the solidarity mechanism
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Costs are to be borne in consideration of the parties’ degree of success in the proceedings (art. 25 par. 5 of the Procedural Rules). 27
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
The amount claimed in the present dispute corresponds to an amount below USD 49,999
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
Therefore, procedural costs levied in this respect shall not exceed USD 5,000 (cf. art. 2 of Annexe 1 of the Procedural Rules). 28
---PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR---
In consideration of the amount claimed, the costs of the proceedings are set at USD 3,000. 29

1. On 22November2022, the Claimant lodged a claim against the Respondent requesting the payment of “24.36% of the total solidarity contribution, plus 5% p.a. interest as of the due date, until the date of effective payment”. 2. The Claimant stated that according to information provided by the Major League Soccer (MLS), the player was transferred from Charlotte MLS (Former club) to the Respondent for a transfer compensation. In this respect, the Claimant referred to art. 1 of Annexe 5 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP) to inform that solidarity contribution is due over any compensation involved in the transfer of the player. 3. On 7 March 2023, the Major League Soccer (MLS), on behalf of the Respondent, informed that no transfer agreement was signed between the parties and no compensation payment was agreed upon for the transfer of the player. 4. The MLS pointed out that all MLS player contracts are agreed between MLS and the player and governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement between MLS and the Major League Soccer Players Association (CBA). In this respect, a player may be re-assigned to different MLS clubs without signing a transfer agreement, maintaining the same employment contract with the league. 5. The MLS stated that on 4 August 2022, the player was re-assigned from Charlotte MLS to the Respondent without signing a transfer agreement. Consequently, there is no transfer agreement to be disclosed to FIFA. 6. The MLS indicated that the MLS Roster & Budget Guidelines (hereinafter MLS Rules) ‘’prohibit payments from one MLS team to another MLS team in consideration for trade of a player’’ and foresee specific cases in which a player may be exchanged, none of which with monetary value. 7. The MLS informed that the transfer of the player from Charlotte MLS to the Respondent occurred in compliance with the MLS Rules, and the above-mentioned clubs agreed on the transfer of the player in exchange for USD 400,000 as General Allocation Money (GAM). In this respect, the MLS explained that GAM ‘’is a mechanism governed by the CBA that allows teams to shift a portion of their Salary Budged (commonly referred to as a ‘’salary cap’’) to another MLS team’’and ‘’it can be used only within an MLS team’s Salary Budged’’. Page 4of 11 REF TMS 11871 8. Finally, the MLS stated that since no payment was made for the transfer of the player, the Claimant is not entitled to solidarity contribution. 9. On 23 March 2023, the Claimant provided its comments to the Respondent’s reply and rejected the Respondent’s allegation that the player was transferred without payment of compensation. 10. The Claimant stated that the MLS confirmed the exchange of the player for USD 400,000 of GAM. 11. According to the Claimant, the GAM corresponds to additional money available annually to MLS clubs, which can be provided to the clubs in specific cases, such as: Failure to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs; The transfer of a club’s player to non-MLS club outside MLS; Qualification for the CONCACAF. Champions League; Expansion Clubs; Expansion Dilution; and Designated Player charge distribution. 12. Additionally, the Claimant pointed out that GAM can be used on several occasions,such as: (i) to "buy-down" a player's Salary Budget Charge as part of managing a club's roster, including buying down a Salary Budget Charge below the League maximum of $612,500; (ii) to sign players new to MLS (that is, a player who did not play in MLS during the previous season); (iii) to re-sign an existing MLS player; (iv) to off-set acquisition costs (loan and transfer fees); (v) in connection with the extension of a player's contract for the second year provided the player was new to MLS in the immediately prior year; (vi) to reduce the Salary Budget Charge of a Designated Player to a limit of $150,000; (vii) to reduce the Salary Budget Charge of a Player whose Salary Budget Charge exceeds the Maximum Salary Budget Charge to a limit of $150,000; and also that the GAMcan be used to reduce 100% of a loan or transfer fee. 13. In this respect, the Claimant referred to art. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP and the FIFA Commentary on the RSTP, which foresee that any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of a player is subject to solidarity contribution, regardless of whether it is described as part of the transfer fee or not. 14. The Claimant added that the concept of “compensation” has been interpreted broadly by the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the Football Tribunal (DRC) in cases such as the swap of players or the triggering of a buy-out clause, and the only compensation which is not subject to solidarity contribution is training compensation. 15. Moreover, the Claimant stated that, according to CAS jurisprudence, (i) the term “compensation” is not limited to the idea of “transfer fee” stricto sensu and must encompass any amount paid by a club on the transfer of a player; (ii) all the elements that should be considered on the transfer of a player for the purpose of solidarity contribution are met in the present case since the Former club consented to release the player, the Respondent consented to secure the player’s services, the player agreed with the transfer, and compensation was paid in form of GAM; and (iii) the RSTP refers to Page 5of 11 REF TMS 11871 compensation without specifying its nature and the Swiss law foresees that the idea of exchange of good involves two sales contracts, and in the present case the financial compensation for the exchange of the player is the amount of 400,000 of GAM. 16. Finally, the Claimant reiterated that the clubs agreed on the amount of USD 400,000 as GAM for the transfer of the player, which was available to the Former club to use in several ways, demonstrating the financial value agreed between the clubs and which shall be subjected to solidarity contribution. 17. The Respondent did not present an answer to the second round of submission. II. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS Applicable law: Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP): March 2022 edition Procedural Rules Governing the Football Tribunal (Procedural Rules): November2022 edition Jurisdiction: yes, uncontested. Admissible: yes, uncontested. Proposed Decision: 1. The Claimant requested the payment of solidarity contribution resulting from the transfer of the player from Charlotte MLS (USA) to the Respondent. 2. According to the Claimant, the Respondent paid for the transfer of the player the amount of USD 400,000 as GAM, which can be used in several situations according to the MLS Rules. In this respect, the Claimant stated that this amount of GAM corresponds to compensation paid for the transfer of the player and, therefore, shall be subject to solidarity contribution. 3. The Respondent argued that no payment was made for the transfer of the player and no solidarity contribution is due to the Claimant. 4. Art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 RSTP stipulates that if a professional moves during the course of a contract, 5% of any compensation, not including training compensation paid to his former club, shall be deducted from the total amount of this compensation and distributed by the new club as a solidarity contribution to the club(s) involved in his training and education over the years. This solidarity contribution reflects the number Page 6of 11 REF TMS 11871 of years (calculated pro rata if less than one year) he was registered with the relevant club(s) between the years of his 12th and 23rd birthdays. 5. It is uncontested that in accordance with the player passport issued by the FVF on 24 January 2022, the player was registered with the Claimant as follows: (i) from 01 July 2016 until 31 December 2016, corresponding to 184 days of the calendar year of the player’s 16thbirthday; (ii) from 30 January 2017 until 31 December 2017, corresponding to 336 days of the calendar year of the player’s 17thbirthday; (iii) from 01 January 2018 until 30 July 2018, corresponding to 211 days of the calendar year of the player’s 18thbirthday; and (iv) from 26 July 2019 to 31 December 2019, corresponding to 159 days of the calendar year of the player’s 19thbirthday. 6. It is uncontested that the player was transferred from Charlotte FC to the Respondent on 04 August 2022 in exchange for USD400,000asGAM. 7. In view of that, the DRC must decide if the amount of USD 400,000 asGAM provided by the Respondent can be encompassed as compensation in the meaning of the RSTP and, if so, what it is the amount of solidarity contribution due to the Claimant. 8. Article 21 and Annexe 5, article 1, of FIFA RSTP, set forth that any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of the player, except for training compensation, shall be subjected to solidarity contribution. Additionally, the FIFA Commentary on the Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players (hereinafter the “FIFA Commentary”) states thatsolidarity contribution is subject to any compensation paid for the transfer of the player, ‘’regardless of whether it is described as part of the transfer fee or not”. 9. According to the DRC and CAS jurisprudence, the concept of “compensation” cannot be considered as a narrow interpretation and therefore shall not be strict to the monetary naturepaidfor the transfer of the player, but it includes any financial benefit which may derive from the transfer of a player. This approach has been applied by CAS and the DRC in cases of entitlement of solidarity contribution triggered by the activation of a buy-out clause orthe swap of players. In fact, the DRC concluded several times thatthe exchange of players indirectly implied a financial agreement, i.e. an agreement with a monetary component, due to the fact that the relevant qualities of the players have an economic value in the football employment market. 10. Against the above framework, according to the MLS Rules, GAM corresponds to an amount available to MLS clubs annually in addition to its salary budget, which can be used in several circumstances such as the signing of new players to MLS, the re-assigning of an existing MLS player, and to off-set loan and transfer fees. 11. In other words, the increasing of the GAM of an MLS club corresponds to a financial advantage to such club considering the different possibilities in which the club can spend Page 7of 11 REF TMS 11871 this resource. The higher the amount of GAM available to a club, the higher the amount that can be spent on signing new players or on compensation of loan or transfer fees. 12. The MLS Rules also foresee that an MLS club may reduce 100% of a loan or transfer fee using the GAM. 13. In this respect and according to the strict financial MLS rules on the amount that can be spent by MLS clubs, it seems that any amount of GAM provided to an MLS club in exchange of the registration of a player corresponds to a payment of compensation that can be spend within the parameters established by the MLS Rules. 14. Bearing in mind that the RSTP clearly establishes the entitlement of solidarity contribution on any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of the player, regardless the nature of the compensation, the amount of GAM provided by the Respondent shall be encompassed as a transfer compensation and the Claimant is entitled to solidarity contribution for the transfer of the player. 15. Finally, and again given the nature of the GAM as described above, the DRC held that any other conclusion as regards the GAM would be to the detriment of uniformity, equality and certainty on football at a global scale because it would enable USA (or Canadian) clubs forming part of the MLS to have a financial advantage over the rest simply because of the MLS’ internal organisation. 16. Consequently, the amount to be taken into account to calculate the solidarity contribution due to the Claimant is USD 400,000. 17. According to art. 1 and 2 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, the player’s new club, i.e. the Respondent, is ordered to remit the relevant proportion(s) of the 5% solidarity contribution to the club(s)involved in the player’s training. 18. It remained undisputed that the Respondent did not pay the solidarity contribution to the Claimant in relation to the amount agreed for the transfer of the player, i.e. USD 400,000. 19. According to art. 21 and art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, 5% of the above compensationshall be deducted as solidarity contribution. 20. As per art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, solidarity contribution for the calendar year of a player’s 16thto 23rdbirthday amounts to 10% of the total solidarity contributionand it is to be calculated on a pro rata basis if a player is registered for less than a year (cfr. Art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP). 21. As established above in point II.5, the Claimant is entitled to receive 24.37% of the due solidarity contribution, corresponding to: 50.27% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 184 days of the calendar year of the player’s 16th birthday; 92.05% of the 10% Page 8of 11 REF TMS 11871 solidarity contribution for the 336 days of the calendar year of the player’s 17thbirthday; 57.81% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 211 days of the calendar year of the player’s 18th birthday; and 43.56% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 159 days of the calendar year of the player’s 19thbirthday. 22. Based on the above, the Respondent shall pay the Claimant solidarity contribution of USD 4,873.96 23. In addition, the Claimant requested the payment of interests over the claimed amount at a rate of 5% p.a.as of the due date. 24. Therefore, taking into account the Claimant’s claim and the well-established jurisprudence of the DRC with regard to interest, the Claimant is entitled to receive interest of 5% p.a. over the amount payable as solidarity contribution as of the 31st day after the date of registration of the player on the permanent basis, i.e.4 September 2022. 25. In view of all the above, the claim of the Claimant is accepted,and the Claimant is entitled to receive USD 4,873.96 as solidarity contribution, plus 5% interest p.a., as from 4 September 2022 until the date of effective payment. 26. Art. 25 par. 2 of the Procedural Rules stipulates that costs in the maximum amount of USD 25,000 are levied in connection with proceedings before the DRC of the Football Tribunal relating to disputes regarding training compensation and the solidarity mechanism. Costs are to be borne in consideration of the parties’ degree of success in the proceedings (art. 25 par. 5 of the Procedural Rules). 27. The amount claimed in the present dispute corresponds to an amount below USD 49,999. Therefore, procedural costs levied in this respect shall not exceed USD 5,000 (cf. art. 2 of Annexe 1 of the Procedural Rules). 28. In consideration of the amount claimed, the costs of the proceedings are set at USD 3,000. 29. In view of the outcome of the claim and the conduct of the parties, said costs shall be born entirely by the Respondent. 30. Art. 24 of the RSTP applies. Page 9of 11 REF TMS 11871 III. DECISION OF THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION CHAMBER 1. The claim of the Claimant, ZAMORA F.C, is accepted. 2. The Respondent, New England Revolution, shall pay to the Claimant USD 4,873.96 as solidarity contribution plus 5% interest p.a. as from 4 September 2022 until the date of effective payment. 3.

Page 3of 11 REF TMS 11871 Claimant club: ZAMORA F.C.(Venezuela) Respondent club: New England Revolution(USA) Claim and Response: 1. On 22November2022, the Claimant lodged a claim against the Respondent requesting the payment of “24.36% of the total solidarity contribution, plus 5% p.a. interest as of the due date, until the date of effective payment”. 2. The Claimant stated that according to information provided by the Major League Soccer (MLS), the player was transferred from Charlotte MLS (Former club) to the Respondent for a transfer compensation. In this respect, the Claimant referred to art. 1 of Annexe 5 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP) to inform that solidarity contribution is due over any compensation involved in the transfer of the player. 3. On 7 March 2023, the Major League Soccer (MLS), on behalf of the Respondent, informed that no transfer agreement was signed between the parties and no compensation payment was agreed upon for the transfer of the player. 4. The MLS pointed out that all MLS player contracts are agreed between MLS and the player and governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement between MLS and the Major League Soccer Players Association (CBA). In this respect, a player may be re-assigned to different MLS clubs without signing a transfer agreement, maintaining the same employment contract with the league. 5. The MLS stated that on 4 August 2022, the player was re-assigned from Charlotte MLS to the Respondent without signing a transfer agreement. Consequently, there is no transfer agreement to be disclosed to FIFA. 6. The MLS indicated that the MLS Roster & Budget Guidelines (hereinafter MLS Rules) ‘’prohibit payments from one MLS team to another MLS team in consideration for trade of a player’’ and foresee specific cases in which a player may be exchanged, none of which with monetary value. 7. The MLS informed that the transfer of the player from Charlotte MLS to the Respondent occurred in compliance with the MLS Rules, and the above-mentioned clubs agreed on the transfer of the player in exchange for USD 400,000 as General Allocation Money (GAM). In this respect, the MLS explained that GAM ‘’is a mechanism governed by the CBA that allows teams to shift a portion of their Salary Budged (commonly referred to as a ‘’salary cap’’) to another MLS team’’and ‘’it can be used only within an MLS team’s Salary Budged’’. Page 4of 11 REF TMS 11871 8. Finally, the MLS stated that since no payment was made for the transfer of the player, the Claimant is not entitled to solidarity contribution. 9. On 23 March 2023, the Claimant provided its comments to the Respondent’s reply and rejected the Respondent’s allegation that the player was transferred without payment of compensation. 10. The Claimant stated that the MLS confirmed the exchange of the player for USD 400,000 of GAM. 11. According to the Claimant, the GAM corresponds to additional money available annually to MLS clubs, which can be provided to the clubs in specific cases, such as: Failure to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs; The transfer of a club’s player to non-MLS club outside MLS; Qualification for the CONCACAF. Champions League; Expansion Clubs; Expansion Dilution; and Designated Player charge distribution. 12. Additionally, the Claimant pointed out that GAM can be used on several occasions,such as: (i) to "buy-down" a player's Salary Budget Charge as part of managing a club's roster, including buying down a Salary Budget Charge below the League maximum of $612,500; (ii) to sign players new to MLS (that is, a player who did not play in MLS during the previous season); (iii) to re-sign an existing MLS player; (iv) to off-set acquisition costs (loan and transfer fees); (v) in connection with the extension of a player's contract for the second year provided the player was new to MLS in the immediately prior year; (vi) to reduce the Salary Budget Charge of a Designated Player to a limit of $150,000; (vii) to reduce the Salary Budget Charge of a Player whose Salary Budget Charge exceeds the Maximum Salary Budget Charge to a limit of $150,000; and also that the GAMcan be used to reduce 100% of a loan or transfer fee. 13. In this respect, the Claimant referred to art. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP and the FIFA Commentary on the RSTP, which foresee that any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of a player is subject to solidarity contribution, regardless of whether it is described as part of the transfer fee or not. 14. The Claimant added that the concept of “compensation” has been interpreted broadly by the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the Football Tribunal (DRC) in cases such as the swap of players or the triggering of a buy-out clause, and the only compensation which is not subject to solidarity contribution is training compensation. 15. Moreover, the Claimant stated that, according to CAS jurisprudence, (i) the term “compensation” is not limited to the idea of “transfer fee” stricto sensu and must encompass any amount paid by a club on the transfer of a player; (ii) all the elements that should be considered on the transfer of a player for the purpose of solidarity contribution are met in the present case since the Former club consented to release the player, the Respondent consented to secure the player’s services, the player agreed with the transfer, and compensation was paid in form of GAM; and (iii) the RSTP refers to Page 5of 11 REF TMS 11871 compensation without specifying its nature and the Swiss law foresees that the idea of exchange of good involves two sales contracts, and in the present case the financial compensation for the exchange of the player is the amount of 400,000 of GAM. 16. Finally, the Claimant reiterated that the clubs agreed on the amount of USD 400,000 as GAM for the transfer of the player, which was available to the Former club to use in several ways, demonstrating the financial value agreed between the clubs and which shall be subjected to solidarity contribution. 17. The Respondent did not present an answer to the second round of submission. II. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS Applicable law: Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP): March 2022 edition Procedural Rules Governing the Football Tribunal (Procedural Rules): November2022 edition Jurisdiction: yes, uncontested.

According to the Claimant, the Respondent paid for the transfer of the player the amount of USD 400,000 as GAM, which can be used in several situations according to the MLS Rules. In this respect, the Claimant stated that this amount of GAM corresponds to compensation paid for the transfer of the player and, therefore, shall be subject to solidarity contribution. 3. The Respondent argued that no payment was made for the transfer of the player and no solidarity contribution is due to the Claimant. 4. Art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 RSTP stipulates that if a professional moves during the course of a contract, 5% of any compensation, not including training compensation paid to his former club, shall be deducted from the total amount of this compensation and distributed by the new club as a solidarity contribution to the club(s) involved in his training and education over the years. This solidarity contribution reflects the number Page 6of 11 REF TMS 11871 of years (calculated pro rata if less than one year) he was registered with the relevant club(s) between the years of his 12th and 23rd birthdays. 5. It is uncontested that in accordance with the player passport issued by the FVF on 24 January 2022, the player was registered with the Claimant as follows: (i) from 01 July 2016 until 31 December 2016, corresponding to 184 days of the calendar year of the player’s 16thbirthday; (ii) from 30 January 2017 until 31 December 2017, corresponding to 336 days of the calendar year of the player’s 17thbirthday; (iii) from 01 January 2018 until 30 July 2018, corresponding to 211 days of the calendar year of the player’s 18thbirthday; and (iv) from 26 July 2019 to 31 December 2019, corresponding to 159 days of the calendar year of the player’s 19thbirthday. 6. It is uncontested that the player was transferred from Charlotte FC to the Respondent on 04 August 2022 in exchange for USD400,000asGAM. 7. In view of that, the DRC must decide if the amount of USD 400,000 asGAM provided by the Respondent can be encompassed as compensation in the meaning of the RSTP and, if so, what it is the amount of solidarity contribution due to the Claimant. 8. Article 21 and Annexe 5, article 1, of FIFA RSTP, set forth that any compensation paid within the scope of the transfer of the player, except for training compensation, shall be subjected to solidarity contribution.

Consequently, the amount to be taken into account to calculate the solidarity contribution due to the Claimant is USD 400,000. 17. According to art. 1 and 2 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, the player’s new club, i.e. the Respondent, is ordered to remit the relevant proportion(s) of the 5% solidarity contribution to the club(s)involved in the player’s training. 18.

According to art. 21 and art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, 5% of the above compensationshall be deducted as solidarity contribution. 20. As per art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP, solidarity contribution for the calendar year of a player’s 16thto 23rdbirthday amounts to 10% of the total solidarity contributionand it is to be calculated on a pro rata basis if a player is registered for less than a year (cfr. Art. 1 par. 1 of Annexe 5 of the RSTP). 21. As established above in point II.5, the Claimant is entitled to receive 24.37% of the due solidarity contribution, corresponding to: 50.27% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 184 days of the calendar year of the player’s 16th birthday; 92.05% of the 10% Page 8of 11 REF TMS 11871 solidarity contribution for the 336 days of the calendar year of the player’s 17thbirthday; 57.81% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 211 days of the calendar year of the player’s 18th birthday; and 43.56% of the 10% solidarity contribution for the 159 days of the calendar year of the player’s 19thbirthday. 22. Based on the above, the Respondent shall pay the Claimant solidarity contribution of USD 4,873.96 23. In addition, the Claimant requested the payment of interests over the claimed amount at a rate of 5% p.a.as of the due date. 24. Therefore, taking into account the Claimant’s claim and the well-established jurisprudence of the DRC with regard to interest, the Claimant is entitled to receive interest of 5% p.a. over the amount payable as solidarity contribution as of the 31st day after the date of registration of the player on the permanent basis, i.e.4 September 2022. 25. In view of all the above, the claim of the Claimant is accepted,and the Claimant is entitled to receive USD 4,873.96 as solidarity contribution, plus 5% interest p.a., as from 4 September 2022 until the date of effective payment. 26. Art. 25 par. 2 of the Procedural Rules stipulates that costs in the maximum amount of USD 25,000 are levied in connection with proceedings before the DRC of the Football Tribunal relating to disputes regarding training compensation and the solidarity mechanism. Costs are to be borne in consideration of the parties’ degree of success in the proceedings (art. 25 par. 5 of the Procedural Rules). 27. The amount claimed in the present dispute corresponds to an amount below USD 49,999. Therefore, procedural costs levied in this respect shall not exceed USD 5,000 (cf. art. 2 of Annexe 1 of the Procedural Rules). 28. In consideration of the amount claimed, the costs of the proceedings are set at USD 3,000. 29. In view of the outcome of the claim and the conduct of the parties, said costs shall be born entirely by the Respondent. 30. Art. 24 of the RSTP applies. Page 9of 11 REF TMS 11871 III.
